\subsubsectionbox{Sources of capital}{pratt2010financial,allen2017principles}{
Management seeks capital to finance operations from two main sources:
\breakspace
\textbf{Shareholders:} Individuals or entities that purchase and hold shares of a company's stock, 
thereby owning a portion of the company's equity. They expect (and are entitled to receive) returns 
through investment appreciation and/or dividends, and also have the right to vote on certain company 
decisions. Unlike debtholders, shareholders have an ownership stake in the company, which carries 
both potential financial rewards and risks, as their investment value can fluctuate with the company's 
performance.
\breakspace
\textbf{Debtholders:}  Individuals or entities that lend capital to a company, usually in the form of 
loans or bonds, with the expectation of being repaid the principal amount along with interest over time. 
Unlike shareholders, debtholders do not obtain ownership stakes in the company, but hold a financial 
claim that is prioritized in the event of liquidation.
\breakspace
The blended result of these contributions is called the \textbf{capital structure}.

\subsubsectionbox{Elements of the Income Statement}{pratt2010financial,}{
\textbf{Revenues} indicate inflow of assets or reduction in liabilities, primarily from sales of 
inventories or services.
\breakspace
\textbf{COGS} or \textbf{Cost of Sales} reflects the original cost of inventory sold, either its purchase price or 
its manufacturing  cost. By subtracting this from Revenues, we arrive at the \textbf{Gross Margin}.
\breakspace
\textbf{R\&D Expenses} or Research \& Development Expenses cover costs like product innovation or supply chain 
optimizations.
Whereas \textbf{SGA Expenses} or Selling, General, and Administrative expenses, encompass costs that 
aren't directly tied to producing an item. This includes expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, marketing,
distribution costs, customer service as well as administrative costs like office supplies, legal fees, etc.
\breakspace
By subtracting the aforementioned expenses, we derive \textbf{EBITDA}, which stands for Earnings Before Interest, 
Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Further adjustments, primarily subtracting depreciation and amortization 
from EBITDA, yield the \textbf{Operating Income}, also known as \textbf{EBIT} (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes).
\breakspace
\textbf{Other revenues} (or expenses) represent minor cash inflows or outflows not related to core operations.
After accounting for these, we determine the \textbf{Net Income}, also referred to as \textbf{Profit}.

\subsection{Accounting for Inventory}

\subsubsectionbox{Accounting categories of Inventory}{pratt2010financial, investopedia}{
Inventory plays a central role in accounting, reflecting a company's financial well-being and operational 
stance. It represents a major portion of a firm's assets, with its management directly affecting 
profitability and liquidity. Therefore, precise record-keeping is  required to offer stakeholders a concise 
financial perspective crucial for investment decisions.
\breakspace
Shifting our lens to manufacturing, we can delineate these specific inventory categories:
\vspace{0.75mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Raw Materials:} Fundamental inputs of a manufacturing process
	\item \textbf{Work in Progress (WIP):} Inventory undergoing transformation from raw materials to final products.
	\item \textbf{Components:} Individual parts, sourced or produced, essential for final product assembly.
	\item \textbf{Finished Goods:} Fully processed products ready for sale.
\end{itemize}
\breakspace
In a broader operational context, beyond pure manufacturing, we also consider:
\vspace{0.75mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Merchandise Inventory:} Ready-to-sell products acquired for resale without additional modification.
	\item \textbf{Supplies:} Operational items not for sale, such as office materials.
	\item \textbf{MRO Items:} Resources for maintenance, repair, and operations, distinct from final product materials.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsectionbox{Capitalization of Inventory Costs \& Units to include}{pratt2010financial}{
Inventories are acquired at a cost and don't generate revenues until they're sold; thus, their cost is 
capitalized. Per the matching principle, the sale revenue is matched with the inventory's cost at the time of sale.
To determine the capitalized cost, first identify the number of inventory items, then assign a cost to each item.
\breakspace
\textbf{General Rule:} Items intended for manufacturing, sale, or consumption should be included in a company's 
inventory only if the company has full ownership of them, meaning that it bears all associated risks and benefits.
Usually, ownership implies possession of the items, and in such cases, the units to be included in the 
inventory can be straightforwardly counted.
\breakspace
However, there are situations where ownership doesn't necessarily  mean direct possession. Two of these 
notable exceptions are: Consignments and Goods in Transit.
}

\subsubsectionbox{Consignments}{pratt2010financial}{
In a consignment arrangement, the \textit{consignor} transfers inventory to a
\textit{consignee}, such as a retailer, who physically holds and sells the items. While the consignor
retains full ownership, the consignee, after selling, keeps a service fee and remits the rest of the
proceeds to the consignor. 

\begin{figure}[H]

Inventory should only be disclosed in the consignor's balance sheet.

\subsubsectionbox{Goods in Transit}{pratt2010financial}{
Theoretically, both a seller and a buyer should record a transaction simultaneously. However, in practice,
most sales are recorded when goods are shipped, while purchases are typically recorded upon receipt of the goods.
This method is generally acceptable, unless there are \textit{goods in transit} at the end of an accounting period.
\breakspace
To properly account for such transactions, it's essential to determine the ownership of the goods while they
are in transit. Freight shipping terms like FOB (free on board) serve this purpose. This term is commonly used 
in domestic shipping within the U.S., and should not be confused
with the FOB term from the International Commercial Terms, INCOTERMS {\sffamily\textregistered} 2020.

}

\subsubsectionbox{Cash Discounts (Early Payment Discounts)}{}{
Incentives for buyers to pay invoices early, improving the seller's cash flow.
For instance, "2/10 net 30" provides a 2\% discount if payment is made within 10 days;
otherwise, the full amount is due by day 30.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=0mm, auto, font=\tiny]

		\node[below=of full.south east] () {day 30};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}%
\vspace{-1.25mm}
Based on the provided terms, buyers can either capitalize on a 2\% discount by paying on day 10, often via a loan, 
or leverage the extended trade credit for 20 more days by settling on day 30. From a financial perspective, it's essential to 
balance the associated debt cost against the opportunity cost of missing the discount or paying the extra amount.\\
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}\centering
	\textbf{Simple interest of the opportunity cost:}
	\[ \left(\frac{0.02}{0.98}\right) \left(\frac{365}{20}\right) \approx 0.37 \]
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}\centering
	\textbf{Compound interest of the opportunity cost:}
	\[ \left(\frac{1}{0.98}\right)^{(\nicefrac{365}{20})} - 1 \approx 0.45 \]
\end{minipage}%
\vspace{2mm}\\
Annualization helps to compare the costs and evaluate alternatives, factoring in either simple or 
compounded interest for the lost funds, based on how the business handles its money.

\subsubsectionbox{Unit Cost: $\boldsymbol{c \to \nicefrac{\$}{\text{unit}}}$}
{kcd2023, silver2016inventory, cachon2018matching, schonsleben2022handbook}{
The cost of obtaining one unit of a SKU, either through procurement or production.
\breakspace
\textbf{For merchants}:
It's the sum of the purchase price paid to the supplier, combined with additional costs necessary 
for preparing the product for sale, such as packaging and labeling. Typically, it also incorporates 
per-unit costs related to freight transportation and material handling, like loading and unloading.
\breakspace
\textbf{For producers}:
It's the total unitary production cost. Similarly, it can also include material handling and freight
transportation costs incurred from production-related activities.
Determining the unit value in manufacturing can be more challenging  due to its intricate nature.
\breakspace
In basic inventory models, the unit cost is typically considered lot-size independent for simplicity.
However, some models account for economies of scale by incorporating discounts related to the volume of 
items purchased or produced, recognizing that unit costs can vary with lot size.
\breakspace
Typically, the unit value is derived from the company's internal accounting system, 
representing its "book value",
therefore, it may differ from what SCM/logistics specialists might consider. 
Ideally, the unit value should be determined collaboratively, taking into account the actual money 
spent on that specific SKU to prepare it for either internal or external use.

each with their respective rates of return.
Given that capital can be sourced from either equity or debt,
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital [WACC] is often used here,
as it's a blended measure for both sources of inventory financing.
\breakspace
\textbf{Incremental Costs of Storage:}
Warehouse space often represents a significant expenditure, especially in prime locations. 
Handling inventory -i.e. moving, organizing within the storage space—adds to the costs. 
Periodic counting or inventory audits are essential for accuracy, but require time and resources. 
Some inventory items might also necessitate special storage conditions, 
such as refrigeration or specific humidity levels, leading to additional expenses.
\breakspace
\textbf{Costs of Depreciation:}
Inventory value can diminish over time due to several reasons. 
Perishable items may degrade, rendering them unsellable. 
As new products are introduced, older items may become obsolete, 
especially in industries with rapid innovation cycles. 
Moreover, shrinkage, resulting from items being lost, stolen, or damaged, 
further erodes the inventory's value.

\subsubsectionbox{Holding Cost: $\boldsymbol{c_e} \to \nicefrac{\$}{(\text{unit}\times\text{period})}$}
{kcd2023, silver2016inventory}{
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{align*}
	\shortintertext{
	Encapsulates all costs incurred from carrying a unit of inventory for a designated period.
	We can model it as:
	}
		&c_e = rc
	\shortintertext{where the \textit{holding rate} $r$ denotes a percentage of the unit value $c$ per 
	period of demand (e.g. for 1 year). A multi-SKU company may opt for $c_{e_i} = r_{i}c_{i}$​ for each SKU $i$ or, 
	to alleviate the complexity of individual analysis, apply a uniform holding rate $r$ across all SKUs.
	Accordingly, $c_e$ has the following dimensions:}
		&\frac{\$}{\text{unit}\times\text{period}}
\end{align*}
By modeling it this way, we can evaluate the cost of keeping inventory proportionally to the amount held.
\breakspace
However, in certain scenarios, the cost of storing an item remains consistent,
regardless of its value. When we employ a singular, aggregated rate $r$,
we inadvertently allow the storage component to escalate in proportion to the item's unit value. 
A more nuanced approach would be to utilize

\[ c_e=rc+h \]

Within this framework, 
$h$ stands as a constant unitary storage fee, while $r$ is solely representative of the cost of capital and
depreciation associated with the item.
\breakspace
Furthermore, consider the scenario where storage capacity is limited; if Q exceeds this threshold, an additional
warehouse is required, incurring a fixed cost. This scenario can be modeled using a piecewise function, for instance:
\[ \text{Total Holding Cost} = \begin{cases}
	Q(rc + h) 						&,\text{for} \; Q \leq \text{threshold}\\
	Q(rc + h) + \text{Fixed Cost} 	&,\text{for} \; Q > \text{threshold}
\end{cases} \]
Given the complexity of the holding cost, it's advisable to model it in collaboration with
Finance/Accounting specialists.

Procurement activities have influence on the Purchase Cost, while Inventory Management activities have
