\subsubsectionbox{Sources of capital}{pratt2010financial,allen2017principles}{
Management seeks capital to finance operations from two main sources:
\breakspace
\textbf{Shareholders:} Individuals or entities that purchase and hold shares of a company's stock, 
thereby owning a portion of the company's equity. They expect (and are entitled to receive) returns 
through investment appreciation and/or dividends, and also have the right to vote on certain company 
decisions. Unlike debtholders, shareholders have an ownership stake in the company, which carries 
both potential financial rewards and risks, as their investment value can fluctuate with the company's 
performance.
\breakspace
\textbf{Debtholders:}  Individuals or entities that lend capital to a company, usually in the form of 
loans or bonds, with the expectation of being repaid the principal amount along with interest over time. 
Unlike shareholders, debtholders do not obtain ownership stakes in the company, but hold a financial 
claim that is prioritized in the event of liquidation.
\breakspace
The blended result of these contributions is called the \textbf{capital structure}.

\subsubsectionbox{Elements of the Income Statement}{pratt2010financial,}{
\textbf{Revenues} indicate inflow of assets or reduction in liabilities, primarily from sales of 
inventories or services.
\breakspace
\textbf{COGS} or \textbf{Cost of Sales} reflects the original cost of inventory sold, either its purchase price or 
its manufacturing  cost. By subtracting this from Revenues, we arrive at the \textbf{Gross Margin}.
\breakspace
\textbf{R\&D Expenses} or Research \& Development Expenses cover costs like product innovation or supply chain 
optimizations.
Whereas \textbf{SGA Expenses} or Selling, General, and Administrative expenses, encompass costs that 
aren't directly tied to producing an item. This includes expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, marketing,
distribution costs, customer service as well as administrative costs like office supplies, legal fees, etc.
\breakspace
By subtracting the aforementioned expenses, we derive \textbf{EBITDA}, which stands for Earnings Before Interest, 
Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Further adjustments, primarily subtracting depreciation and amortization 
from EBITDA, yield the \textbf{Operating Income}, also known as \textbf{EBIT} (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes).
\breakspace
\textbf{Other revenues} (or expenses) represent minor cash inflows or outflows not related to core operations.
After accounting for these, we determine the \textbf{Net Income}, also referred to as \textbf{Profit}.
}

\subsubsectionbox{Profitable operations as a source of capital}{pratt2010financial}{
Retained earnings represent the cumulative profits a company has generated and chosen to reinvest in the business 
rather than distribute as dividends. They don't pinpoint a specific tangible asset or cash pool. 
Instead, they indicate the portion of the assets listed on the balance sheet that stems from profitable operations.

\subsection{Accounting for Inventory}

\subsubsectionbox{Accounting categories of Inventory}{pratt2010financial, investopedia}{
Inventory plays a central role in accounting, reflecting a company's financial well-being and operational 
stance. It represents a major portion of a firm's assets, with its management directly affecting 
profitability and liquidity. Therefore, precise record-keeping is  required to offer stakeholders a concise 
financial perspective crucial for investment decisions.
\breakspace
Shifting our lens to manufacturing, we can delineate these specific inventory categories:
\vspace{0.75mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Raw Materials:} Fundamental inputs of a manufacturing process
	\item \textbf{Work in Progress (WIP):} Inventory undergoing transformation from raw materials to final products.
	\item \textbf{Components:} Individual parts, sourced or produced, essential for final product assembly.
	\item \textbf{Finished Goods:} Fully processed products ready for sale.
\end{itemize}
\breakspace
In a broader operational context, beyond pure manufacturing, we also consider:
\vspace{0.75mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Merchandise Inventory:} Ready-to-sell products acquired for resale without additional modification.
	\item \textbf{Supplies:} Operational items not for sale, such as office materials.
	\item \textbf{MRO Items:} Resources for maintenance, repair, and operations, distinct from final product materials.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsectionboxEDIT{Capitalization of Inventory Costs (Cost Deduction)}{pratt2010financial, taxfoundationLIFO}{
Inventories are acquired at a cost and don't generate revenues until they're sold; thus, their cost is 
capitalized. Per the matching principle, the sale revenue is matched with the inventory's cost at the time of sale.
To determine the capitalized cost, first identify the number of inventory items, then assign a cost to each item.
\breakspace
To understand the policy conversation about LIFO and FIFO, one must understand two main philosophies of 
calculating income: the pure income approach and the cash flow approach.

The income approach focuses on matching deductions for costs with the revenues they generate. For example, 
if a farm invests in a new tractor that it will use for 10 years, it should spread the deductions for that 
tractor out over the next 10 years. When applying this principle to inventories, companies should deduct 
the cost of a unit of inventory when it is sold.

The cash flow approach suggests companies should deduct their costs right when those costs are incurred. 
In the case of the farm investing in a new combine, it should deduct the full cost of the combine immediately.
When applying this principle to inventories, companies should deduct the cost of a unit of inventory when it 
is acquired.

For accountants and financial analysts, the income (or book income) approach makes sense for determining the 
financial health of a company—this approach shows that, for instance, a decline in cash flow thanks to major 
investment decisions does not mean that the company is “losing money,” as those investment costs can get spread 
out. Meanwhile, the cash flow-based approach makes the most sense from a tax economics perspective because 
deducting investment costs when they are incurred means a company can deduct the full real cost, without 
inflation and the time value of money eating away at the deduction’s value (which occurs when deductions 
are spread over several years).

For some issues, companies can use one set of rules to calculate financial income and another set of rules to 
calculate taxable income —which also makes sense, as they measure different things. But in the case of LIFO and 
FIFO, both systems are, at least on paper, based on the book income approach. Both systems have companies deduct 
the cost of a unit of inventory when it is sold, not when it is acquired. Additionally, companies must use the 
same system for both financial and taxable income.
}

\subsubsectionboxEDIT{Units to include}{pratt2010financial}{
\textbf{General Rule:} Items intended for manufacturing, sale, or consumption should be included in a company's 
inventory only if the company has full ownership of them, meaning that it bears all associated risks and benefits.
Usually, ownership implies possession of the items, and in such cases, the units to be included in the 
inventory can be straightforwardly counted.
\breakspace
However, there are situations where ownership doesn't necessarily  mean direct possession. Two of these 
notable exceptions are: Consignments and Goods in Transit.
}

\subsubsectionbox{Consignments}{pratt2010financial}{
In a consignment arrangement, the \textit{consignor} transfers inventory to a
\textit{consignee}, such as a retailer, who physically holds and sells the items. While the consignor
retains full ownership, the consignee, after selling, keeps a service fee and remits the rest of the
proceeds to the consignor.

Inventory should only be disclosed in the consignor's balance sheet.

\subsubsectionbox{Goods in Transit}{pratt2010financial}{
Theoretically, both a seller and a buyer should record a transaction simultaneously. However, in practice,
most sales are recorded when goods are shipped, while purchases are typically recorded upon receipt of the goods.
This method is generally acceptable, unless there are \textit{goods in transit} at the end of an accounting period.
\breakspace
To properly account for such transactions, it's essential to determine the ownership of the goods while they
are in transit. Freight shipping terms like FOB (free on board) serve this purpose. This term is commonly used 
in domestic shipping within the U.S., and should not be confused
with the FOB term from the International Commercial Terms, INCOTERMS {\sffamily\textregistered} 2020.

\subsubsectionbox{Cash Discounts (Early Payment Discounts)}{allen2017principles, smith1987trade}{
They're incentives for buyers to pay invoices early, improving the seller's cash flow.
For instance, "2/10 net 30" provides a 2\% discount if payment is made within 10 days;
otherwise, the full amount is due by day 30.

\vspace{-1.25mm}
Based on the provided terms, buyers can either capitalize on a 2\% discount by paying on day 10, often via a loan, 
or leverage the extended trade credit for 20 more days by settling on day 30. From a financial perspective, it's essential to 
balance the associated debt cost against the opportunity cost of missing the discount or paying the extra amount.\\
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}\centering
	\textbf{Simple interest of the opportunity cost:}
	\[ \left(\frac{0.02}{0.98}\right) \left(\frac{365}{20}\right) \approx 0.37 \]

\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}\centering
	\textbf{Compound interest of the opportunity cost:}
	\[ \left(\frac{1}{0.98}\right)^{(\nicefrac{365}{20})} - 1 \approx 0.45 \]

Annualization helps to compare the costs and evaluate alternatives, factoring in either simple or 
compounded interest for the lost funds, based on how the business handles its money.

\subsubsectionboxEDIT{Inventory record keeping: Periodic and Perpetual Systems}{pratt2010financial}{
\textbf{Periodic System:}

}

\subsubsectionbox{Inventory Valuation Methods and COGS Allocation}{pratt2010financial, repealLIFO, amazonCOGS}{
While theoretically possible, allocating inventory costs to specific items often proves impractical for most firms
due to the need for extensive physical counting or advanced tracking systems. This challenge leads companies to 
adopt standardized valuation methods, which, beyond simplifying the process, can also strategically influence 
financial reporting and taxation.
\breakspace
\textbf{Specific Identification:} Often used for high-value items and increasingly with common items through 
barcode and RFID technology, ensures the highest accuracy in inventory acquisition cost allocation and ending
inventory  valuation by tracking individual items. However, it allows for potential manipulation of net income,
as the  cost of goods sold can be selectively influenced by choosing specific items for sale.
\breakspace
The \textbf{FIFO (First-in-First-Out)} method calculates COGS using the oldest inventory costs, while the 
ending inventory is valued at the most recent costs. During times of rising prices, this can result 
in COGS being reported at lower, outdated costs, potentially understating the actual expense and inflating 
profits in inflationary periods.
\breakspace
The \textbf{LIFO (Last-in-First-Out)} method determines COGS using the most recent inventory costs and ending
inventory is valued at the oldest costs. In inflationary times, this can lead to COGS reflecting higher,
more current prices, possibly overstating expenses and reducing reported profits, but it may also offer tax 
advantages due to lower taxable income.
\breakspace
\textbf{Weighted Average:} This method calculates COGS and ending inventory value using a periodically updated weighted 
average cost, reflecting not just a simple average but a proportionate cost of goods, thus ensuring a balanced 
approach to inventory valuation.

\subsubsectionbox{LIFO: Implications for Financial Reporting and Taxation}{pratt2010financial, repealLIFO,
taxfoundationLIFO, investopediaLIFOReserve}{
In periods of rising prices, inventory acquired later is often more expensive, and so the LIFO method allows for 
the deduction of higher inventory costs, leading to decreased reported earnings and lower tax burdens.
Conversely, during times of declining prices, LIFO can result in lower deductions, overstating both earnings 
and tax liabilities. The strategic implications of these scenarios under LIFO require careful considerations.
\breakspace
\textbf{Inventory Turnover:} Determined by COGS divided by Average Inventory, serves as a benchmark for comparing 
efficiency across similar industries. However, in times of inflation, LIFO's elevated COGS can lead to seemingly 
higher Inventory Turnover ratios, which may overstate a company's effectiveness in managing its inventory.
\breakspace
The \textbf{LIFO Reserve}, representing the difference between FIFO and LIFO inventory valuations, facilitates 
comparisons between companies with different accounting methods. It indicates inventory undervaluation on the
balance sheet and the cumulative reduction in taxable income for the firm.
}

\subsubsectionbox{LIFO and Just-in-Time Inventory Management}{kinney2004jit}{
\cite{kinney2004jit} studied behaviors related to Just-In-Time inventory management, LIFO reserve dynamics, 
and financial decision-making in firms during the 1980s and 1990s, a period in which JIT gained popularity:
\breakspace
\textbf{Earnings Impact in LIFO Reserve Firms:} Firms with significant LIFO reserves often see short-term earnings 
increases following JIT adoption, as the liquidation of lower-cost LIFO inventories reduces COGS and boosts profits.
\breakspace
\textbf{FIFO and Minimal LIFO Reserve Firms:} Companies operating under FIFO or with small LIFO reserves may 
find that the  initial costs of implementing JIT can offset or even negate short-term productivity or efficiency 
gains.
\breakspace
\textbf{JIT Adoption in High-Leverage Firms:} High-debt firms with large LIFO reserves tend to adopt JIT, 
suggesting they use JIT-induced LIFO liquidations to manage debt-related constraints.
\breakspace
\textbf{Tax Rates Influencing JIT Adoption:} In high-tax scenarios, the likelihood of JIT adoption diminishes for 
firms with large LIFO reserves, as JIT's low inventory levels limit the tax benefits of LIFO reserves, and their 
liquidation can lead to unfavorable tax consequences.

\subsection{Inventory Costs}

\subsubsectionbox{Unit Cost: $\boldsymbol{c \to \nicefrac{\$}{\text{unit}}}$}
{kcd2023, silver2016inventory, cachon2018matching, schonsleben2022handbook}{
The cost of obtaining one unit of a SKU, either through procurement or production.
\breakspace
\textbf{For merchants}:
It's the sum of the purchase price paid to the supplier, combined with additional costs necessary 
for preparing the product for sale, such as packaging and labeling. Typically, it also incorporates 
per-unit costs related to freight transportation and material handling, like loading and unloading.
\breakspace
\textbf{For producers}:
It's the total unitary production cost. Similarly, it can also include material handling and freight
transportation costs incurred from production-related activities.
Determining the unit value in manufacturing can be more challenging  due to its intricate nature.
\breakspace
In basic inventory models, the unit cost is typically considered lot-size independent for simplicity.
However, some models account for \textbf{economies of scale} by incorporating discounts related to the volume of 
items purchased or produced, recognizing that unit costs can vary with lot size.
\breakspace
Typically, the unit value is derived from the company's internal accounting system, representing its
"\textbf{book value}", therefore, it may differ from what SCM/logistics specialists might consider. 
Ideally, the unit value should be determined collaboratively, taking into account the actual money 
spent on that specific SKU to prepare it for either internal or external use.
}


\subsubsectionbox{Ordering/Setup Cost: $\boldsymbol{c_t} \to \nicefrac{\$}{\text{order}}$}{}{
}

\subsubsectionbox{Cost components of holding inventory}{
	silver2016inventory, axsater2015inventory, chopra2016scm, brandimarte2000}{
They vary across companies and SKUs, but, in general, they include the
following major components, which must be incremental in nature, otherwise,
they would have been incorporated as part of the fixed ordering cost:
\breakspace
\textbf{Cost of Capital:}
Capital is allocated to either purchase or produce inventory units, 
so less inventory means more available capital for alternative investments,
each with their respective rates of return.
Given that capital can be sourced from either equity or debt,
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital [WACC] is often used here,
as it's a blended measure for both sources of inventory financing.
\breakspace
\textbf{Incremental Costs of Storage:}
Warehouse space often represents a significant expenditure, especially in prime locations. 
Handling inventory -i.e. moving, organizing within the storage space—adds to the costs. 
Periodic counting or inventory audits are essential for accuracy, but require time and resources. 
Some inventory items might also necessitate special storage conditions, 
such as refrigeration or specific humidity levels, leading to additional expenses.
\breakspace
\textbf{Costs of Depreciation:}
Inventory value can diminish over time due to several reasons. 
Perishable items may degrade, rendering them unsellable. 
As new products are introduced, older items may become obsolete, 
especially in industries with rapid innovation cycles. 
Moreover, shrinkage, resulting from items being lost, stolen, or damaged, 
further erodes the inventory's value.
}

\subsubsectionbox{Holding Cost: $\boldsymbol{c_e} \to \nicefrac{\$}{(\text{unit}\times\text{period})}$}
{kcd2023, silver2016inventory}{
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{align*}
	\shortintertext{
	Encapsulates all costs incurred from carrying a unit of inventory for a designated period.
	We can model it as:
	}
		&c_e = rc
	\shortintertext{where the \textit{holding rate} $r$ denotes a percentage of the unit value $c$ per 
	period of demand (e.g. for 1 year). A multi-SKU company may opt for $c_{e_i} = r_{i}c_{i}$​ for each SKU $i$ or, 
	to alleviate the complexity of individual analysis, apply a uniform holding rate $r$ across all SKUs.
	Accordingly, $c_e$ has the following dimensions:}
		&\frac{\$}{\text{unit}\times\text{period}}
\end{align*}
By modeling it this way, we can evaluate the cost of keeping inventory proportionally to the amount held.
\breakspace
However, in certain scenarios, the cost of storing an item remains consistent,
regardless of its value. When we employ a singular, aggregated rate $r$,
we inadvertently allow the storage component to escalate in proportion to the item's unit value. 
A more nuanced approach would be to utilize

\[ c_e=rc+h \]

Within this framework, 
$h$ stands as a constant unitary storage fee, while $r$ is solely representative of the cost of capital and
depreciation associated with the item.
\breakspace
Furthermore, consider the scenario where storage capacity is limited; if Q exceeds this threshold, an additional
warehouse is required, incurring a fixed cost. This scenario can be modeled using a piecewise function, for instance:
\[ \text{Total Holding Cost} = \begin{cases}
	Q(rc + h) 						&,\text{for} \; Q \leq \text{threshold}\\
	Q(rc + h) + \text{Fixed Cost} 	&,\text{for} \; Q > \text{threshold}
\end{cases} \]
Given the complexity of the holding cost, it's advisable to model it in collaboration with
Finance/Accounting specialists.

\[ TC = cD + c_{t}\frac{D}{Q} + c_{e}\frac{Q}{2} + c_{s}E[\text{Units Short}] \]

Procurement activities have influence on the Purchase Cost, while Inventory Management activities have 
influence on the other costs.

\subsubsectionbox{Consequences of the Axioms}{}{
By set theory definitions we have: \boxed{A \cup A^{c} = \Omega} \, and \,  \boxed{A \cap A^{c} = \emptyset}
\bcentering{P(A) \leq 1}
$A$ and $A^{c}$ are disjoint $\then P(A \cup A^{c}) = 1 = P(A) + P(A^{c}) \then P(A^{c}) = 1 - P(A)$,
and by \textit{nonnegativity} we get $P(A^{c}) \geq 0 \then P(A) \leq 1 \qed$
\bcentering{P(\emptyset) = 0}
Let $A = \Omega \then P(\Omega) + P(\Omega^{c}) = 1 \then 1 + \emptyset = 1  \then P(\emptyset) = 0 \qed$\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
Let $\Omega$ be a finite set and $A_{1},...,A_{n}$ be disjoint events, then:
\bcentering{P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i} \right) = \sum_{1}^{n} P(A_{i})}
$P(A \cup B \cup C)=P\left[(A \cup B) \cup C\right]$. From additivity, given that the events are disjoint, we have $(P(A) + P(B)) + P(C)$.
By induction we can extend this to $n$ disjoint sets $\qed$\\
%\vspace{2mm}
Let $\{\omega_{1},...,\omega_{k}\}$ be a discrete, finite set of sample points, then:
\bcentering{P\big(\{\omega_{1},...,\omega_{k}\}\big) \then P\left(\,\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}\{\omega_{j}\} \right) \then \sum_{j=1}^{k}P\big(\{\omega_{j}\}\big)}
because $\{\omega_{1},\dots,\omega_{k}\}$, can be seen as the union of \textit{unit sets}, and since they are disjoint, additivity applies $\!\qed$.
Although, a simpler, non rigorous notation can be used: $\sum_{j=1}^{k}P(\omega_{j})$.
}

\subsubsectionbox{More Consequences of the Axioms}{}{
Consider the condition $P(A \cap B) \geq 0, \then$ The events could be joint, therefore, more generally:\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
{\centering
	\begin{minipage}{1.75cm}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\fill[draw=\ldraw, fill opacity=0.5, red!90!white] (0:0pt) circle (8pt);
			\fill[draw=\ldraw, fill opacity=0.5, blue!90!white] (0:10pt) circle (8pt);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{minipage}%
	\begin{minipage}{4cm}
		\boxed{P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)}
	\end{minipage}
\\}
%\vspace{1.5mm}
Which can be generalized to the...:
\bcentering{P\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right) = -\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k \sum_{1 \leq i_{_1} < ... < i_{_k} \leq n} P \left( \, \bigcap_{j=1}^{k} A_{i_j} \right)}
From the above, the \textit{Union Bound} property follows: \boxed{P(A \cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B)}\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
Consider that $A$ is included in $B$, then:\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
{\centering
	\begin{minipage}{1.75cm}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\begin{axis}[hide axis, xmin=0, xmax=1, ymin=0, ymax=1, clip=false, width=2.8cm,height=2.3cm,]
				\fill[draw=\ldraw, fill opacity=0.5, red!90!white] (0.5,0.5) ellipse (14pt and 8pt);
				\fill[draw=\ldraw, fill opacity=0.5, blue!90!white] (0.4, 0.5) circle (4.5pt);
				\draw[line width=0.05mm] (axis cs:0,0) rectangle (axis cs:1,1);
			\end{axis}
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{minipage}%
	\begin{minipage}{3cm}
		\boxed{A \subset B \then P(A) \leq P(B)}
	\end{minipage}
\\}
%\vspace{1.5mm}
since $B = A \cup (B \cap A^{c}) \then P(B) = P(A) + P(B \cap A^{c}) \geq P(A) \qed$ \\  
%\vspace{1.5mm}

Consider 3 sets not necessarily disjoint, e.g.:\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
\begin{minipage}{2cm}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\fill[draw=none, fill opacity=1, green!60!white] (0:0pt) circle (8pt);
		\fill[draw=none, fill opacity=1, blue!60!white] (60:10pt) circle (8pt);
		\fill[draw=none, fill opacity=1, red!60!white] (120:10pt) circle (8pt);
		\draw [draw=black, line width=0.05mm] (0:0pt) circle (8pt);
		\draw [draw=black, line width=0.05mm] (60:10pt) circle (8pt);
		\draw [draw=black, line width=0.05mm] (120:10pt) circle (8pt);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{3cm}
	\boxed{P(A \cup B \cup C) =  \textcolor{red}{P(A)} + \textcolor{blue}{P(A^{c} \cap B)} + \textcolor{green!70!black}{P(A^{c} \cap B^{c} \cap C)}}
\end{minipage}
\\
%\vspace{1.5mm}
Visually, we can check the boxed expression by the matching of the colors, and since the subsets are disjoint, additivity holds.  Notice the expression also applies to disjoint sets $\qed$

\subsubsectionbox{Multiplication Rule}{}{
%\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{align*}
	\shortintertext{Notice that:}
		P(A \cap B) &= P(B) P(A|B) \\
					&= P(A) P(B|A) \\
	\shortintertext{And for 3 events we have:}
		P[(A \cap B) \cap C] &= P(A \cap B) P(C|A \cap B) \\
						   &= P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A \cap B)\\
	\shortintertext{More generally:}
		\Aboxed{P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\right) &= P(A_{1})\prod_{i=2}^{n}P\left(A_{i} \Bigg| \bigcap_{j=1}^{i-1} A_{j} \right)}
\end{align*}\\
A particular intersection of events would be represented as a full path in a probability tree.
